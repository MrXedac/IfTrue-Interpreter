# IfTrue Oriented Programming interpreter

Basically this is a crap language highly inspired from brainfuck.

You can compile it using "make", install it using "make install".

Run it by invoking "iti [source]". Some examples are provided in the examples/ folder.

Note : this is shit. Seriously. Use brainfuck if you're that twisted.

Other note : this has been written in ~20min. The code might be broken. Especially the loop part. Feel free to pull request/fork...
